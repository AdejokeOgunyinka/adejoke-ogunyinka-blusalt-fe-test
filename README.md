# NextJS + React + TS
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
It's an assessment for a job interview to gauge my understanding of frontend development using React JS & Next.js.

## Getting Started
After cloning the project, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family.

## Deployed Version / Demo
This project was deployed on Netlify [adejoke-ogunyinka-blusalt-fe-assessment](https://adejoke-blusalt-fe-test.netlify.app/).
